this is the main branch for WorkInstructions. Branches will contain each assembly and will contain:

1. a folder containing merged images after they have been sent independently to GitHub
2. a form of instructions synthesized
3. the derived drawing

program files can be found in "main" which are executable to recieve files into the repository,
take files out to synthesize, and page through the instructions by the aid of sensors on the 
network. User Interfaces are also stored on the main function and organized accordingly.
